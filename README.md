# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
These are the projects I worked on while attending The Tech Academy C# and .net BootCamp.

Projects:
- [Car Insurance]

Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
